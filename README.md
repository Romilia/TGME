# There will be three options which the user can select thorugh inputting numbers and pressing enter.
# The three main menu options are Candy Crush, Bejeweled, and Player stats.

## If you click Candy Crush you will be taken to a screen where two players shall sequentially play Candy Crush.
# Player one will finish level one, then player two will finish level one, and so on until level 5 in complete.
# The objective of each level is to meet the target score before your number of turns run out.
# Here are the special tiles in Candy Crush:
# Rocket (Tile: #): Removes all instances of the specific piece in the direction it is being swapped with from the board.
# Bomb (Tile: !): Removes all surrounding tiles within one tile of the piece it is swapped with.
# Chocolate Sprinkle (Tile: *): Removes all column or row pieces depending on the direction it is swapped in. For example, if it is swapped upright, it will remove all tiles in the column.
#if two rocket tiles are swapping with each other, all tiles in the same column and row of the swapped tile will be removed.
#if two chocolate sprinkle tiles are swapping with each other, all tiles on the board will get removed.

## If you click Bejeweled you will be taken to a screen where two players shall play Bejeweled one after the other.
# The objective of each level is to meet the target score before your timer runs out.
# After player 1 finishes 5 levels, it will be turn for player 2 to play 5 levels.
